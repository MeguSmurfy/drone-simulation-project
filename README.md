### Introduction 

### How to use the simulation

To run this project you need to be able to connect to the UMN CSE Lab Machines in some capacity. Once connected to a Lab machine, follow these instructions:

```
# Change to the project directory
cd /<filepath>

# Make the project
make -j

# Start the project (./build/web-app <port> <web folder>)
./build/bin/transit_service <port> /apps/transit_service/web/

```
Once you have started the server, you can access the scheduling page at http://127.0.0.1:<port>/schedule.html and the visualization of the delivery at http://127.0.0.1:<port> with <port> being the same port number you chose to launch the server on.
